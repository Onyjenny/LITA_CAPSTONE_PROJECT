### Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store 

### Project Overview

In today's data-driven world, the ability to interpret and leverage data has become a pivotal skill.For this project,I embarked on an analytical journey to unveil insights through data analysis.I was able to uncover trends and patterns within a diverse dataset

### Project Objectives

The primary aim of this project was to utilize data analysis techniques to uncover key insights such as top selling products,regional performance and monthly sales trend.By exploring the dataset I sought to:

- Identify key performance indicators(KPIs) that reflect the data's performance.
- Highlight trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions.
- Provide a comprehensive narrative that translates complex data into understandable insights.

### Data Source

The primary source of data used here is  which is provided by LITA during the excel class.

### Methodology
This project employeed a structured approach involving various data analysis tools and techniques:

 - Microsoft excel  [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   1. for data cleaning
   2. analysis and visualization
 - Structured Query Language (SQL)
   1. for quering
   2. extraction and manipulation of data
 - PowerBI for visualization and report
 - Github for portfolio building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation,the following actions was performed;
1. data loading and inspections
2. handling missing variables
3. data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
1. Excel:
- Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
total sales by product, region, and month.
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and
total revenue by region.
- Create any other interesting report
2. SQL:
Hint â€“ You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and
validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
- retrieve the total sales for each product category.
- find the number of sales transactions in each region.
- find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
- calculate total revenue per product.
- calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
- find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
- calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
- identify products with no sales in the last quarter.

3. Power BI:
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The
dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and
regional breakdowns.
